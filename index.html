				The island of Manhattan is roughly 13.4 miles long and 2.3 miles at its widest. As of 2017, there were nearly a quarter million privately owned vehicles in this area with that number significantly increasing in response to the 2020 pandemic. As we consider the impacts of Manhattan being host to so many vehicles, here is a list of some of New York City’s transportation alternatives.

				Cycling is safer than ever. NYC’s Green Wave plan is an effort by multiple agencies within the city to encourage New Yorkers to ride their bikes. One of the plan’s main goals is to keep cyclist as safe as possible, so the DOT has worked to add 20 additional miles of protected bike lanes each year, so far, creating a grid of 480 miles of protected lanes.

				NYC’s subway, inaugurated in 1904, is one of the world’s oldest running public transit systems. With 472 stations operating throughout the city, there are very few places the train won’t get you close to. The Subway system operates 24/7.
